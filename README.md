## About me

 I'm a Data Analyst and Engineer in Risk Prevention, Quality, and Environment. I have experience in environmental consulting and safety projects for companies across various sectors, and I possess the knowledge to develop ETL processes, EDA, and dashboard generation using tools like SQL, Python, and Power BI.

My interest in data analysis began when I realized the immense potential of data to revolutionize industries and solve real-world challenges. I was fascinated by how data can provide deep, fact-based insights for decision-making, improving efficiency and effectiveness in various fields. Additionally, I recognize that this capability of data can be applied not only to the environmental sector but to any sector.
